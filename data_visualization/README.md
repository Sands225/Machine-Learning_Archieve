# Basic Guide to Data Visualization

<p style="text-align: justify;">Data visualization is the process of representing data and information using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps. The goal is to make complex data easier to understand, spot pattenrs and communicate insights effectively.</p>

## Introduction to Data Visualization

<p style="text-align: justify"> <b>Data visualization</b> is the practice of presenting data in a pictorial or graphical format to make <b>complex information easier to understand</b> and interpret. <br>

### What's involves in Data Visualization?
<p style="text-align: justify"> Data visualization involves the use of charts, graphs, maps, and other visual elements to highlight patterns, trends, and relationships within data, enabling users to extract meaningful insights effectively. This visual representation amplifies cognition by leveraging human visual perception, making it quicker and easier to identify important features and anomalies in large datasets. </p>

### What's the purpose of Data Visualization?
<p style="text-align: justify"> Data visualization also supports interactive exploration and analysis, helping users engage with data for better decision-making and sense-making activities. It has evolved significantly with computer technology, becoming an essential tool in fields like data science, analytics, research, and business intelligence. The goal is to communicate data in ways that are both effective and efficient for understanding complex information. </p>

## Types of Visualizations

<p style="text-align: justify"> Different types of visualizations serve different purposes. The choice of visualization depends on the nature of the data and the insights we want to communicate. Below are some common types: </p>

### Line Graph
<p style="text-align:justify"> Line Graph is a visualization used to display quantitative values across a continuous interval or over time. It shows trends and how data changes over a period. </p>

</div>

#### How to Read
Data points are plotted on a Cartesian coordinate grid and connected with lines.
- X-axis: usually a timescale or sequence of intervals.
- Y-axis: represents the quantitative values (can include negative values below the axis).

- Trends:
    - Upward slope = increasing values
    - Downward slope = decreasing values

- Patterns formed by the line can reveal trends in the dataset.

#### Tips
- Use to show changes or trends over time.
- Limit to 3–4 lines per chart to avoid clutter.
- If more comparisons are needed, use small multiples (separate charts for each series).

### Bar Charts
<p style="text-align: justify"> A bar chart uses horizontal or vertical bars to compare numerical values across categories. </p>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
<!-- <img src="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/anatomy/bar_chart.png"> -->
</div>

#### How to Read
- X-axis / Y-axis: one shows categories, the other shows numerical values.
- The length/height of each bar represents the value for that category.
- Used to answer “how many?” in each category.

#### Tips
- Best for <b>categorical</b> (discrete) data, not continuous intervals.
- Do not confuse with histograms (which show continuous distributions).
- Choose between horizontal vs. vertical bars depending on readability.

### Histogram
A histogram is a chart that shows the distribution of data over a continuous interval. It groups values into intervals (bins) and uses bars to represent the frequency of data within each bin.

#### How to Read
- X-axis: the continuous intervals (bins).
- Y-axis: frequency (how many values fall into each bin).
- Bar height = frequency of data in that interval.
- Helps identify where values are concentrated, extremes, gaps, or unusual values.

### Pie Charts

### Scatter Plots
